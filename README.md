#Timesless Boutiques

This website is a simulated e-commerce website.
It was created by me, Xamarys Liranzo (also known as Xaidyn), Manaal Muddassir, Santiago Murillo, and Jean Malinao.
I was the project manager for this website and oversaw all creations and modifications towards this project.
Alongside being a project manager, I was in charge of coding parts of the front and back end of this project.
I contributed to the CSS, HTML, PHP, and SQL features of this website. 
I was also in charge of the sanitation and debugging stages of this project. 
This project took about a whole university semester to complete.
